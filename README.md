### Notes (updated as of Project Launch)
#### On running the program
- Please disable any ad blockers on your web browser/alternatively whitelist the root host before clicking on `Open All` in the specific workspace to open all associated links
- Please enter valid links that start with `https://www.`, `http://www.`, `http://`, or `https://` when adding new links (`Open All` only opens valid links to the browser)
#### On testing the program
- The RSpec and Cucumber tests cover all models, views, and controllers
- Our joint results currently yield [XX.XX%] coverage.
#### On test results
- Joint RSpec and Cucumber coverage locally yields [XX.XX%]. However, when deploying to heroku, there was an error to "define constant ApplicationCable::Connection, but didnt". In order to fix this, we uncommented the code in the `app/channels/application_cable/*` files. These two classes under this module `application_cable` are unused, but were left in for heroku deployment purposes.

## Running the program locally
0.  `bundle install` (installs necesarry gems, etc.)
1.  `rails webpacker:install` (not currently included in gemfile due to environment discrepancies - will be rectified) 
2.  `rails db:drop` (optional, only if needed to destroy database first)
3.  `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed` (create, migrate, and seed the database)
4.  `rails server` (launch web server locally)
5.  open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or `http://[::1]:3000` on a web browser

## Running the test suite
#### Testing with RSpec
Run `bundle exec rspec`
#### Testing with Cucumber
Run `rake cucumber`
#### View complete coverage report
Run `open coverage/index.html`
